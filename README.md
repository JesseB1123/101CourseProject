# U_decide

For anyone who can’t decide where to eat, unlike Siri or any individuals’ personal wealth of knowledge, U_decide is a personal restaurant locator that helps people first discover what exactly they want and then guide them there.

The process should be simple; the system presents a type of food for the user to either agree to or disagree to. If the answer is no, this stage of the process repeats until the correct food is found. When the answer is yes, the user will be presented with restaurant options that serve that type of food. (Optional: clicking on the desired restaurant will take the user to a map that can guide them there).
